# Status

Kept up to date after every work session so the work can be resumed from this repository alone.
Design: `docs/PLAN.md`. Source survey: `docs/RESEARCH.md`. CI state: branch `ci-status`, file `STATUS-CI.md`.

## Milestones

| M | Content | State |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | CI builds unmodified 4.1.4 FE + BE; artifacts downloadable | **done**: FE run 39408957469; full BE (4.1.4 + thrift patch) run 39412648088, one job, Build BE 11:10–12:40 UTC (90 min, 4 vCPU, partly warm ccache); incremental BE with patch 0003: run 39447876098, Build BE 7 min |
| M1 | FE catalog `flight`: schemas, tables, type mapping, secret masking | **done in CI** (compile + unit tests FlightTypeMapperTest, FlightSqlRendererTest, FlightPropertiesTest: 14/14, run 39447425479); functional check is M4 |
| M2 | BE native scanner (partial mode, location failover, cancellation), Arrow → Chunk | thrift (0001), FE FlightScanNode (0004), BE connector 0003 compiles and links (current: run 39484148997); BE unit test 0007 against an in-process Flight server **18/18 green** incl. basic auth and TLS (be-ut run 39514450368); functional check is M4 |
| M3 | Pushdown: projection, filters (BE re-check), LIMIT, count(*), GROUP BY aggregation; TOP-N fix | **done in CI**: projection/filters/LIMIT, `FlightAggregationPushdownRule` (GROUP BY + count/sum/min/max, also covers count(*)), session switches (0004); TOP-N fix (0005). Unit tests + plan test FlightScanPlanTest (7/7, EXPLAIN REMOTE SQL) green (run 39465778230); functional check is M4 |
| M4 | Bench tests, moved to CI as far as possible (`docs/M4-CI.md`); short final check on the maintainer's stand | **CI part green**: `m4.yml` + `ci/m4/` checks 1–9 **all pass** on series `4a9848e-fl598360` (run 39665941130; TPC-H SF1 22/22 with topn default and 0, types, pushdown, failover, KILL, token/TLS, memory, log masking). Summary `docs/M4-RESULTS.md`. Left: local final check (M4-CI §6) |
| M5 | Package: patch series + artifacts + install guide | `docs/INSTALL.md` drafted (release assets described); patch series of 7 patches (0007 = BE unit test; current series `4a9848e-fl598360`, FE 39664615702, BE 39664594320); release workflow `release.yml` + `ci/release.sh` **done**: draft release `v4.1.4-flight.0-dryrun` is for the old series `4a9848e-fl80f999` (run 39527877395) — refresh; publish after M4 |

## Patch series (on tag 4.1.4)

| Patch | Content | State |
|---|---|---|
| 0001 thrift | TFlightScanNode, TFlightScanRange, TTableType FLIGHT_TABLE (free ids per RESEARCH.md) | done |
| 0002 fe connector | `connector/flight/`: FlightConnector, FlightMetadata, FlightProperties, FlightTypeMapper, FlightSqlMetadataClient (connect probe: ListActions bounded by `flight.connect_timeout_ms`), FlightSqlRenderer, FlightAggregationPushdown, FlightRemoteFileDesc, FlightGetRemoteFilesParams; `catalog/FlightTable`, Table, ConnectorType; Authorizer, StmtExecutor (catalog type); masking (PrintableMap, CredentialUtil, SqlCredentialRedactor, CatalogMgr logs) | compiles (with the series) |
| 0003 be | `be/src/connector/flight_connector.{h,cpp}` (FlightConnector/DataSourceProvider/DataSource, cancel watcher, failover, connect timeout via `grpc.min_reconnect_backoff_ms`, Arrow→Chunk via ParquetScanner converters, conjuncts + LIMIT in the source; registered with the cancel watcher before the first connect), ConnectorType FLIGHT + registration, CMakeLists, exec_node FLIGHT_SCAN_NODE (+ collect_scan_nodes), descriptors FLIGHT_TABLE → plain TableDescriptor (no descriptors.h change: ~840 TUs include it); UInt64 columns widened to decimal128(20,0) for DECIMAL slots (our server streams UInt64 in result mode partial where its metadata says decimal128(20,0)); `exec/arrow_to_starrocks_converter.cpp`: Arrow timestamp → DATETIME by floor division (upstream bug: pre-1970 values with a fraction became garbage; M4 fix 2026-10-21) | compiles + links (BE run 39664594320) |
| 0004 fe optimizer/planner | `planner/FlightScanNode`; Logical/PhysicalFlightScanOperator, FlightScanImplementationRule, **FlightAggregationPushdownRule** (rewriteOnce in QueryOptimizer after RewriteSimpleAggToHDFSScanRule; remote items are bare `fn(expr)`, casts inside: `sum(CAST(x AS T))`; integer sums only in result mode complete — M4 fix 2026-10-21), edits in OperatorType, visitors, RuleSet/RuleType, MultiOpPattern, PushDownPredicateScanRule, PruneScanColumnRule, MergeLimitDirectRule, StatisticsCalculator, RelationTransformer, PlanFragmentBuilder, Explain, LogicalPlanPrinter; SessionVariable `flight_filter_pushdown`, `flight_aggregate_pushdown` | compiles |
| 0005 fe | PushDownTopNToPreAggRule: ORDER BY must cover all GROUP BY keys; PushDownTopNToPreAggRuleTest | test passes (run 39453420117) |
| 0006 fe tests | FlightTypeMapperTest, FlightSqlRendererTest, FlightPropertiesTest, FlightAggregationPushdownRuleTest, FlightScanPlanTest (+ MockedFlightSqlMetadataClient: Flight SQL metadata without a server), FlightSqlMetadataClientTest (in-process Java Flight server: failover from a silent / refused URI, no failover on server errors) | all pass (FE run 39484391882) |
| 0007 be test | `be/test/connector/flight_connector_test.cpp` (standalone, own main; registered with ADD_BE_TEST): in-process `arrow::flight::FlightServerBase`; type conversion (incl. UInt64→LARGEINT, naive / zoned timestamps), chunk slicing, failover from a refused location, no failover when disabled / on server errors, wrong token, connect timeout against a silent listener, cancel of a blocked read, read limit, conjuncts; basic auth (handshake → bearer, wrong password not leaked), TLS with a self-signed cert generated at test time (root certs + override hostname, TLS + basic auth, hostname mismatch, untrusted cert, `tls_verify=false`, plain client vs TLS server); pre-1970 timestamps with a fraction (ms/us/ns); UInt64 stream into a DECIMAL(20,0) slot | 20/20 pass (be-ut run 39664598409) |

The split (2026-10-20) left the patched source tree byte-identical; 0001 and 0003 files are unchanged. Patches 0002
and 0004 are only built as part of the whole series (0002 alone has no reference to 0004's classes).


## CI

- `fe.yml`: FE jars (~12 min with warm Maven cache). `be-ut.yml`: `flight_connector_test` (~6 min: restores
  the newest `ccache-be-*` read-only, builds the Release tree with the test target appended to be/CMakeLists.txt
  by `ci/build-be-ut.sh` — the upstream MAKE_TEST/ASAN UT build would share nothing with our ccache — and runs
  it; report artifact `be-ut-report-<run>`). Runs on pushes of thrift/be patches or its own files, or via
  `be-ut` in `ci/dispatch.txt` (input `filter` = gtest filter). `be.yml`: `starrocks_be`, chained jobs `part1..part4` (each
  < 6 h, ccache carried in actions/cache); if 4 parts are not enough the run re-dispatches itself.
- Builds are skipped when an output for the same input hash is cached (`fe-out-<hash>`, `be-out-<hash>`); a
  forced rebuild (or an FE build with tests) replaces the cache entry.
- `m4.yml` (manual, `m4 checks=1,2,3` in `ci/dispatch.txt`): MinIO + our Flight server (release `m4-assets`) +
  allin1 4.1.4 overlaid with the current series' FE/BE outputs, checks `ci/m4/m4.py`; results artifact `m4-<run>`
  and branch `m4-results` (`git show origin/m4-results:latest.md`). Details: `docs/M4-CI.md` §7.
- `release.yml` (manual, `release tag=v… draft=true prerelease=true` in `ci/dispatch.txt`): builds nothing; takes
  the FE/BE outputs of the current input hashes from the caches (or the newest `fe-jars-*` / `starrocks_be-*`
  artifact when the cache is missing or stale), requires both to report the series hash `4.1.4-<base>-fl<patches>`
  (`ci/release.sh`; after an FE-only patch change run `be force=true`, a ccache-only rebuild, and vice versa) and
  creates the GitHub Release (assets: fe-jars tar, starrocks_be.zst, patches tar.gz, INSTALL.md, build-info files,
  SHA256SUMS). A draft creates no git tag; re-running with a draft's tag replaces it, published ones are refused.
- Push-triggered builds (branches `main` and `claude/**`) react only to their patch areas (`*-thrift-*`,
  `*-fe-*`, `*-be-*`). `concurrency: cancel-in-progress` — a new push touching BE patches CANCELS a running BE
  build on the same branch.
- The repo is private again since 2026-10-21 (~2000 Actions minutes/month; see CLAUDE.md). A full BE build on the 4-vCPU runner is many hours; incremental BE builds with a warm ccache are short. Any change to patch 0001 (thrift) regenerates headers used
  everywhere = near-full BE rebuild, so batch thrift changes and avoid them.

## Log

- 2026-10-20 13:31 MSK: CI scripts and workflows. FE M0 build OK. BE M0 build started.
- 2026-10-20 14:00 MSK: handoff from the local session to the cloud routine. WIP FE code exported as patch 0002.
  Added `dispatch.yml`, `ci-report.yml`, `scripts/export-patches.sh`, docs/PLAN.md, docs/RESEARCH.md.

- 2026-10-20 11:05–11:40 UTC (cloud session): probe OK; dispatched full BE build run 39412648088. FE build of
  patch 0002 OK (run 39412699319). Added FlightScanNode, masking, quoting fix, 3 test classes; FE build+tests
  dispatched (run 39414525761, result not seen). BE connector draft saved to `wip/` (kept out of `patches/` so the
  running BE build is not cancelled). Session stopped early on the maintainer's request.

- 2026-10-20 15:17–16:12 UTC (cloud session): BE M0 confirmed (run 39412648088, 90 min). FE test run 39414525761
  had failed on a duplicate `package` line in FlightSqlRendererTest; fixed, 14/14 tests pass (run 39447425479).
  BE connector moved from `wip/` into patch 0003 with connector/exec_node/descriptors/CMake wiring; compiles and
  links (run 39447876098, 7 min incremental). Added FlightAggregationPushdownRule (GROUP BY + count/sum/min/max,
  count(*) included), session switches `flight_filter_pushdown` / `flight_aggregate_pushdown`, Explain and
  LogicalPlanPrinter entries, FlightAggregationPushdownRuleTest (run 39449820889 failed: count(NULL) was rendered;
  fixed, run 39451627570 green). TOP-N fix as patch 0004 with PushDownTopNToPreAggRuleTest (run 39453420117 green;
  current FE artifact `fe-jars-e0cd7c224349f274`).
  Wrote `docs/M4-TESTS.md` and `docs/INSTALL.md`. Review of 0003 found that `flight.rpc_timeout_ms` (default 0 =
  none) was also the deadline of the streaming DoGet, so with a timeout set any longer endpoint read would have
  failed: now only the basic-auth handshake uses it. Arrow converters are now built once per stream instead of per
  chunk (BE run 39453716203 green, 7 min).

- 2026-10-20 17:15–18:07 UTC (cloud session): FlightScanPlanTest (PlanTestBase + MockedMetadataMgr + a
  FlightSqlMetadataClient stub with two endpoints): EXPLAIN REMOTE SQL for projection, pushed WHERE (BE re-check
  kept), LIMIT only with all conjuncts pushed, count(*) → `count(*) AS "__flight_agg_0"` + coalesce, GROUP BY with
  WHERE/HAVING (scan without predicate), avg / count(distinct) / unpushable conjunct not pushed, both session
  switches; 7/7 green on the first run (FE run 39465778230, artifact `fe-jars-a98b4da77859eeaf`). BE:
  `flight.connect_timeout_ms` now bounds each connect attempt via `grpc.min_reconnect_backoff_ms` (min 100 ms;
  calls are not wait-for-ready, so an unreachable location fails over after it); BE run 39465826698 green (5 min).
  Split the FE patch into 0002 connector / 0004 optimizer+planner / 0006 tests (BE now 0003, TOP-N 0005; source
  tree identical, same FE input hash);
  the split series applies and builds, and the 6 FE test classes pass (FE run 39470578122). Session ended 18:07 UTC.

- 2026-10-20 19:16–20:20 UTC (cloud session): Next step 1 done. BE unit test `flight_connector_test` (new patch
  0007) against an in-process `arrow::flight::FlightServerBase`: all mapped types convert as designed (UInt8→SMALLINT
  and UInt64→LARGEINT widen, naive timestamp keeps its wall clock, zoned timestamp is shown in the session zone,
  DECIMAL128→DECIMAL64, VARBINARY), batches are sliced to chunk_size, failover from a refused location (1 DoGet),
  none when disabled or on a server error, wrong token fails without the token in the message, a silent location
  (TCP accepted, no HTTP/2) fails over after 1004 ms with `connect_timeout_ms`=1000 (so
  `grpc.min_reconnect_backoff_ms` does bound the connect on gRPC 1.43; risk R3 settled), cancel wakes a blocked
  read in ~400 ms, read limit and conjuncts work: 10/10 (be-ut run 39489468073). Found while writing it: a stalled
  connect/first read in `open()` was not cancellable (the source registered with the cancel watcher only after
  the stream started); fixed in 0003 (BE run 39484148997 green). New CI job `be-ut.yml` + `ci/build-be-ut.sh`
  (Release tree + appended test target, BE ccache read-only, ~4 min); runs 39484149185, 39484779489, 39486204186,
  39487039672, 39487742279, 39488591786 failed on CI plumbing (build.sh `--module` takes no argument, protected
  member → `-fno-access-control`, libjvm/libjemalloc path, config env vars). Next step 2 done as well: the FE
  metadata client probes a new connection with ListActions bounded by `flight.connect_timeout_ms` (any answer =
  reachable) and fails over otherwise; FlightSqlMetadataClientTest (in-process Java Flight server, silent /
  refused URI, no failover on server errors) + the other 6 FE test classes green (FE run 39484391882).

- 2026-10-20 21:16–21:35 UTC (cloud session): Next step 1 (M5 release workflow). New `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  + `ci/release.sh` (see CI above); `ci-report` also follows release runs. First dry run 39499303111 failed on its
  consistency check: the cached `starrocks_be` (run 39484148997) reports series `4a9848e-fl76a25f`, built before
  the last FE-only 0002 change, the jars `fl14c16b`. Forced BE rebuild (run 39499533941, same BE sources, Build BE
  74 s) — and fe.yml / be-part.yml now replace an existing output cache entry on a rebuild (the old one could not
  be overwritten). Second dry run 39500542342 green: **draft** pre-release `v4.1.4-flight.0-dryrun` (no git tag
  yet) with fe-jars tar, starrocks_be.zst (sha256 60e1a2bc…), patches tar.gz, INSTALL.md, build-info files,
  SHA256SUMS; FE from run 39484391882, BE from run 39499533941. INSTALL.md describes the release assets. No patch
  changed (no source preparation needed).
- 2026-10-20 23:15–23:35 UTC (cloud session): Next step 1 (BE auth/TLS tests) done. Patch 0007 gained 8 cases:
  a Basic-auth server middleware (Handshake `authorization: Basic …` → `Bearer` header) checks the user/password
  handshake path and that a wrong password fails before DoGet without appearing in the status; TLS uses an EC
  P-256 self-signed cert generated with OpenSSL at test time (no key material in the repo): root certs + override
  hostname OK, with basic auth OK, hostname mismatch and untrusted cert fail, `tls_verify=false` OK without
  root certs, plain client vs TLS server fails. TLS errors arrive as UNAVAILABLE, so with several locations a
  misconfigured TLS location is failed over like an unreachable one (acceptable; noted for M4). Pre-checked locally
  against pyarrow 19.0.1's libarrow_flight. CI: be-ut run 39514450368 18/18 green on the first run; BE run
  39514450436 green (Build BE 81 s, ccache-only). No connector code changed.

- 2026-10-21 01:15–01:40 UTC (cloud session): no M4 results yet (step 1 waits). Old step 2 done: forced FE rebuild
  for the series hash after the 0007 change (FE run 39526375694, 5 min, no tests), then the draft
  `v4.1.4-flight.0-dryrun` re-created for series `4a9848e-fl80f999` (release run 39527877395 green; FE 39526375694,
  BE 39514450436). No patch changed.
- 2026-10-21 16:27 UTC (cloud session): no M4 results yet; noted the 7-day artifact/cache retention under Next
  step 2. No patch changed, no CI run.
- 2026-10-21 18:41–20:08 UTC (cloud session): M4 moved into CI. New `m4.yml` + `ci/m4/stack.sh` (MinIO —
  docker.io/minio is gone, quay.io/bitnamilegacy/chainguard fallbacks, boto3 single-PUT upload —, our Flight
  server from release `m4-assets` on JDK 21, allin1 4.1.4 overlay) + `ci/m4/m4.py` (checks 1–9 vs DuckDB 1.4.1 /
  SF1 reference); results on branch `m4-results`, summary `docs/M4-RESULTS.md`. Plumbing runs 39655898917
  (cancelled), 39656305326, 39656873818, 39657625118 failed (MinIO image, multipart upload, read-only server cwd).
  First real run 39658484728 found: (1) result mode partial rejects `CAST(sum(..))` → 0004 renders
  `sum(CAST(x AS T))`, integer sums only in complete mode; (2) Arrow timestamps before 1970 with a fraction were
  garbage (upstream converter, truncating division) → 0003 floors; (3) UInt64 wrapped: the server streams
  `uint64` in partial mode where its metadata says decimal128(20,0) → 0003 widens. Tests in 0006/0007. Builds:
  FE 39660196425 (7 Flight test classes green), BE 39660201177, be-ut 39660205090; then FE 39664615702, BE
  39664594320, be-ut 39664598409 (20/20). M4 runs 39661743301, 39663221891, and **39665941130: all 9 checks pass**
  on series `4a9848e-fl598360`. ci-report now follows m4 and prints billable minutes correctly (was ms).

## Next steps

1. `docs/LOCAL-FINAL-CHECK.md` for the maintainer (M4-CI §6: HDFS/hadoopfs SF10 with `bench/reference/sf10`,
   3-node kill tests, speed vs JDBC bridge and Trino plugin, production-like server build), then refresh the
   draft release for series `4a9848e-fl598360` (`release tag=v4.1.4-flight.0-dryrun draft=true prerelease=true`;
   FE 39664615702 and BE 39664594320 are current).
2. M4 CI hardening (small, rerun only the touched check): check 8 should also grep a query profile for the
   token; check 6 "during" should prove the kill overlapped the read (in run 39665941130 the read finished
   correctly 1.2 s after the kill, so a failover/abort may not have been exercised); check 1 could compare DESC of
   the types tables with PLAN §2.2 exactly. Any new failure: fix in the patches, rebuild, rerun only that check.
3. After the maintainer's final check passes and they agree: `release tag=v4.1.4-flight.1 draft=false
   prerelease=false`; delete the `v4.1.4-flight.0-dryrun` draft. Retention: CI artifacts 7 days, caches evicted
   after 7 days without access — after a long pause expect a full BE rebuild (~90 min). Every patch change needs
   FE **and** BE outputs of the new series before `m4` or `release` (the other side: `fe/be force=true`).

## Open questions for the maintainer

- Server findings from M4 CI (not connector bugs; the connector now works around both): (a) in result mode
  `partial` the server rejects any expression around an aggregate (`CAST(sum(x) AS T) AS a` → Binder Error
  "Referenced column … not found"), so integer `sum` is no longer pushed in partial mode; (b) in partial mode a
  DuckDB UBIGINT column is streamed as `uint64` while GetTables/complete mode say `decimal128(20,0)`. Worth fixing
  in the server; tell me if the connector should instead push integer sums as `sum(CAST(x AS DECIMAL(38,0)))`.

- Heads-up: the draft release `v4.1.4-flight.0-dryrun` still holds the old series `4a9848e-fl80f999` (before the M4
  fixes); it is refreshed in Next step 1. The allin1 paths of `docs/INSTALL.md` §2a are now verified by `m4.yml`.
- Release naming: the workflow takes any tag `v…`; proposed `v4.1.4-flight.N`. Publishing (draft → public, which
  creates the git tag) is left to you after M4.
- 2026-10-21 (maintainer): M4 moves to CI as far as possible (docs/M4-CI.md); only a short final check runs on
  the local stand. The repo is private again because the `m4-assets` release holds our server build.
